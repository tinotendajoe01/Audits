# Vulnerability Report: Exposure of Password via Event Emission

**Title:** Exposure of Password via Event Emission

**Severity:** Medium

## Vulnerability Details

**Relevant Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
event SetNetPassword();
```
````

**Summary of the Finding:**
The `PasswordStore` contract emits an event named `SetNetPassword()` each time a new password is set. This event includes the new password information as one of its parameters. This exposes sensitive data to potential attackers monitoring transactions. A malicious actor could eavesdrop on this event, extract the new password, and potentially compromise the security of the contract.

**Impact:**
The impact of this vulnerability is two-fold. Firstly, it exposes sensitive data, compromising the confidentiality of the stored password. Secondly, it could lead to unauthorized access or misuse of the password, depending on the attacker's intentions. The potential impact of this vulnerability ranges from medium to high, depending on how the exposed data is exploited.

**Tools Used:**

- RemixIDE

The attack vector can be recreated using the following steps:

1. Follow the documentation to deploy the contract.
2. Copy the contract address and open RemixIDE.
3. Deploy the `PasswordStore` at the given address.
4. Set the password using the `setPassword` function.

By following these steps, you can observe the event emission and its exposure of sensitive data.

## Recommendation

To mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability, consider the following recommendation:

1. **Eliminate the Event:** Consider removing the `SetNetPassword()` event from the contract. This event does not appear to bring significant value and exposes sensitive information, making it a potential target for malicious actors. By removing it, you can reduce the risk of event-based attacks and enhance the security of the contract.

In conclusion, the vulnerability arises from the exposure of sensitive data through the emission of the `SetNetPassword()` event. A potential attacker could exploit this event to gain access to the stored password, leading to unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive data. To address this issue, it is recommended to eliminate the event to ensure that sensitive data, such as the password, is not exposed in this manner.
