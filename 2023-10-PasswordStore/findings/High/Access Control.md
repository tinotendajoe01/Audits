## Summary

Unauthorized users may exploit the access control vulnerability by calling the `setPassword` function and changing the password, potentially leading to unauthorized access and changes in the contract state.

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper access control in the smart contract. As a result, any user can potentially set a new password, which should only be allowed for the contract owner. Unauthorized changes to the password can compromise the security and integrity of the contract.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it allows unauthorized users to alter the password, undermining the security of the `PasswordStore` contract and potentially causing disruptions to the intended functionality.

## Tools Used

No specific tools are involved in this vulnerability. It's a fundamental access control issue that can be addressed through code and design improvements.

## Recommendations

To mitigate this access control vulnerability, it is crucial to implement proper access control mechanisms. The following steps can be taken to secure the contract:

1. Create an `onlyOwner` modifier that checks the `msg.sender` against the owner's address and apply this modifier to the `setPassword` function:

   ```solidity
   error ONLY_OWNER_CAN_CALL_THIS_FUNCTION();
   modifier onlyOwner() {
      if(msg.sender != s_owner){
       revert ONLY_OWNER_CAN_CALL_THIS_FUNCTION();
              }
       _;
   }


   function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external onlyOwner {
       s_password = newPassword;
       emit SetNetPassword();
   }
   ```

2. An alternative approach is to inherit the `Ownable` contract from OpenZeppelin to provide built-in access control functionality:

   ```solidity
   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

   contract PasswordStore is Ownable {
       // Rest of the contract code

       function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external onlyOwner {
           // Rest of the function code
       }
   }
   ```

   These recommendations help ensure that only the owner of the contract can set the password, enhancing security and access control.
